DocASAP will respond to notices of alleged infringement regarding Third Party Content sent pursuant to, and in accordance with, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), which may include DocASAP removing or disabling access to Third Party Content claimed to be the subject of infringement or other activity. All notices sent to DocASAP regarding matters other than informing DocASAP that a party's copyrighted material may have been infringed (and relating only to Third Party Content) will not receive a response through this process.</p>

						<li>A statement, as follows: "The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I swear that I am the copyright owner or that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed".</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Upon receipt of written notification containing the information outlined in (1) through (6) above:</p>

					<ul>

					</ol>
					<p>Upon receipt of a Counter Notification containing the information outlined in (1) through (4) above, the DMCA provides that the removed material will be restored or access re-enabled and DocASAP will comply with this requirement within a reasonable time (or as otherwise required by law), provided that the Designated Agent has not received notice from the original complaining party that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain Subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on DocASAP's network or system.</p></li>
